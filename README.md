Task 2 — Phishing Email Analysis  

# Phishing-Email-Analysis
This project demonstrates the analysis of a sample phishing email to identify and document phishing indicators such as sender spoofing, header anomalies, suspicious links, urgent language, and malicious attachments. The task follows cybersecurity best practices for safe email examination using header analyzers and static inspection.

# Phishing Email Analysis


Objective :-
Analyze a phishing email sample and identify phishing characteristics. Produce a report listing indicators and mitigation suggestions.


Deliverables :-
- `REPORT.md` — detailed analysis and findings.
- `sample_email.txt` — the phishing email sample used for analysis (redacted).
- `header_analysis.txt` — instructions and sample header-check notes.


How to use :-
1. Clone this repo locally.
2. Open `sample_email.txt` to inspect the original message.
3. Run header checks using a free header analyzer (e.g., MXToolbox, Mail-Tester, or other online tools) and paste the output into `header_analysis.txt`.
4. Read `REPORT.md` for the full analysis and suggested next steps.


Notes :-
This repo is for educational purposes. Do not interact with any suspicious links or attachments in a live environment; analyze them only in safe, sandboxed environments.
