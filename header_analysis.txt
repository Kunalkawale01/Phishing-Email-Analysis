# Header analysis — steps and sample notes

1. Paste the raw email headers into a free header analyzer (e.g., MXToolbox "Email Header Analyzer", Mail-Tester, or AbuseIPDB tools).

2. Check the following:
- `Received:` chain — does the originating IP match the vendor's mail servers?
- `SPF` result — pass/neutral/fail?
- `DKIM` — signature present and valid?
- `DMARC` — policy and result?

3. Example findings (replace with your analyzer output):

- Received: from [34.201.45.68] (unknown [34.201.45.68])
- SPF: `softfail` for sender `gmail.com` — suspicious.
- DKIM: no valid signature for `acme.com`.
- DMARC: `none` — no enforcement in place.

Interpretation: The Received path indicates the message originated from a cloud VM IP (not from acme.com mail servers). Authentication checks did not confirm the sender as legitimate.

Copy your analyzer output here for record-keeping and for the incident report.
